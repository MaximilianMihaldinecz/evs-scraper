# evs-scraper
Python script to scrape European Voluntary Services ( EVS ) projects.

# Motivation
European Voluntary Services is an amazing opportunity to volunteer abroad. Unfortunately, the user interface provided that allows searching these projects is suboptimal. This script was created to help those who want to find their dream volunteer project.

# What it does
1. It scrapes https://europa.eu/youth/volunteering/project_en pages for available projects
2. Creates text file with the results you can use to process as you wish
